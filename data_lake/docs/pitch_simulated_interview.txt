Pitch: MSME Profile & Decisioning Platform — Simulated Founder Interview

Elevator pitch
We convert fragmented MSME digital traces (bank transactions, GST returns, credit reports, mutual funds, insurance, OCEN, ONDC) into compact, auditable customer profiles and explainable risk/affordability scores that lenders can use to underwrite, price and monitor thin-file borrowers faster and with fewer manual reviews.

One-line value prop
Explainable debt capacity + cashflow signals for MSMEs, enabling higher coverage and safer portfolio expansion.

Data & schema (what we store and why)
- Sources: bank transactions, GST returns, credit bureau extracts, mutual fund holdings, insurance policies, OCEN applications, ONDC orders, plus any CSV/API feeds.
- Normalization: canonical `customer_id`, `generated_at` timestamp, `_numeric_amount` normalization, merchant/category mapping, GSTIN→state mapping, dataset presence counters.
- Per-customer outputs (examples in `analytics/`):
  - `overall_summary.json`: dataset counts, composite scores, debt_capacity_breakdown, business_health contributors, recommendation.
  - `transaction_summary.json`: totals, by_type breakdown, unknown narrations, monthly_cashflow, amounts_stats.
  - `earnings_spendings.json`: cashflow metrics, seasonality, top_customers exposure.
  - `gst_summary.json`: monthly_turnover, by_state, mapping_debug, compliance_score.
  - `credit_summary.json`: bureau_score, open_loans, utilization, payment_history.
  - `anomalies_report.json`: anomaly types, top_transactions, fraud flag.

Architecture & pipeline (founder-focused)
- Ingestion: connectors (sFTP/APIs/CSV) into staging.
- ETL/Normalization: parse dates/amounts, map narratives to merchants/categories, deduplicate across accounts.
- Enrichment: merge bureau and platform data, merchant & industry lookup.
- Storage: append-only raw store + compact per-customer JSON summaries (analytics) + timeseries in columnar store.
- Scoring: rule-based components + lightweight ML; each score carries provenance and text explanations.
- Interfaces: REST API, batch exports, analyst UI, webhook integrations for lenders.

Core analytics & models
- Normalizers: regex/heuristics + dictionary + ML entity extraction for narrations.
- Cashflow stability: coefficient of variation and percent-with-amount over rolling windows.
- Business health: GST compliance, revenue scale, provider diversity, investments.
- Debt capacity: structured composite (base_floor + credit_component + repayment_bonus + DTI + OCEN + insurance + regularity), with `debt_capacity_breakdown` showing numeric contributions.
- Anomaly detection: rule thresholds + unsupervised clustering for outliers.
- Explainability: `calculation` and `mapping_debug` objects in outputs.

Product outputs & integrations
- Per-customer JSON packages, batch CSVs, decisioning API returning scores + rationale.
- Dashboard: customer timeline, score breakdown, anomaly drilldown, manual override with audit trail.
- Alerts & streaming: near-real-time for high-severity anomalies and OCEN approvals.

Operations & infra
- Pilot footprint: cloud storage, containerized ETL workers, Postgres + timeseries store, API service.
- Scale considerations: keep per-profile JSONs small; move heavy timeseries to columnar DB; autoscale ingestion workers.
- SLAs: daily profile refresh (default), minutes for critical alerts; uptime SLAs for API endpoints.

Security & compliance
- Encrypt data at rest/in transit, RBAC, consent capture and storage, audit logs and lineage for each derived score, support for deletion requests and legal holds.

Business model & GTM
- Customers: banks, NBFCs, digital lenders, underwriting platforms.
- Pricing: subscription per-profile + per-decision API fees or revenue share.
- GTM: pilot with regional NBFCs → case studies → enterprise sales.

KPIs to measure in pilots
- Coverage (% profiles produced), approval uplift for thin-file segments, manual review reduction, NPL change, time-to-decision, ARPU.

Roadmap (12 months)
- Q1: Harden ingestion, mapping, per-customer APIs, 1–2 pilots.
- Q2: Add streaming for critical signals, OCEN integration, UI for lenders.
- Q3: Supervised models trained with pilot labels; risk-pricing prototype.
- Q4: Enterprise features (SLA, multi-tenant security), partner integrations.

Simulated Interview — Likely Founder Questions and Expected Answers

Product & value
Q: What exact problem are we solving and for whom?
A: We enable lenders to underwrite MSMEs with limited credit history by producing explainable affordability and risk signals from multiple data sources, reducing manual reviews and expanding addressable customers.

Q: Top three lender KPIs this improves?
A: Approval uplift for thin-file customers, manual review cost reduction, and portfolio default reduction.

Q: How do we differ from bureau reports?
A: We fuse bureau with cashflow, GST, and platform signals to estimate real-time affordability and detect operational anomalies; plus we provide controllable, auditable provenance for each score.

Data & quality
Q: What if GST or bank data is missing for a customer?
A: Profiles are additive and confidence-scored; debt capacity uses conservative defaults and marks low-confidence components for manual review to avoid over-optimistic approvals.

Q: How do you normalize messy narrations and dates?
A: Layered processing: heuristics + merchant dictionaries + ML entity extraction; mapping_debug tracks applied rules and versions.

Q: How to deduplicate multiple accounts or repeated transactions?
A: Transaction fingerprinting (date+amount+narration hash) and account clustering heuristics; duplicates are collapsed when aggregating cashflows.

Models & explainability
Q: Is debt_capacity a black box?
A: No — it is a compositional score with explicit numeric components and text explanations; each number is traceable to raw inputs via calculation_debug.

Q: How to validate without ground truth?
A: Use proxy signals (bureau late-payment flags), pilot labels, backtests on historical data, and conservative production thresholds; iterate with lender feedback.

Engineering & infra
Q: Minimum infra for a pilot?
A: Object storage, a small containerized ETL worker cluster, a Postgres/timeseries DB, and a stateless API — deployable in a cloud tenant or customer VPC.

Q: How do we scale to millions of profiles?
A: Keep per-profile JSONs small; store long timeseries in a columnar store; shard ingestion; use caches for hot profiles.

Security & compliance
Q: How do you handle PII and consent?
A: Capture consent upstream, encrypt PII, store minimal PII downstream, and maintain audit trail for data lineage and deletion requests.

Business & go-to-market
Q: Who pays and what pricing?
A: Lenders typically pay. Offer subscription per-profile + per-decision fees; pilot discounts and outcome-based pricing for early partners.

Q: How fast to show ROI in pilots?
A: Expect measurable improvements in 3 months for manual review reduction; stable default/approval signals need 6–12 months for robust validation.

Deep technical probes
Q: Show lineage for a score.
A: Provide calculation_debug: source datasets, raw input values, intermediate components, weights and final aggregation; reproducible from stored raw data.

Q: How to prevent gaming?
A: Cross-source triangulation (GST vs bank vs platform), anomaly detection for synthetic/structured gaming patterns, and conservative thresholds until validated.

Q: What data contracts are required?
A: Contracts must cover allowed use, retention windows, security standards, breach obligations, and rules about sharing derived outputs.

Appendix — Are we missing any data sources or product features?
Missing or high-value additional data sources:
- GST e-invoice / ewaybill feeds (higher fidelity invoicing and counterparty data).
- Marketplaces & payment gateway settlements (Amazon Seller, Razorpay, PayU) for transaction-level merchant sales.
- Accounting software exports (Tally, QuickBooks, Zoho Books) for ledger-level P&L and inventory details.
- POS or invoicing platforms for retail MSMEs.
- Supplier/payables data and purchase orders (supply-side cashflow visibility).
- Udyam / business registration and MSME registry metadata.
- Telecom/utility/land records (alternative signals for stability).

Recommended product features to add:
- Decisioning & risk-pricing engine (auto-calibrated PD -> price recommendations).
- Model governance: training/validation pipelines, drift detection, A/B testing harness.
- Consent & consent lifecycle management UI and APIs.
- Analyst workflow + dispute resolution UI for flag reviews and corrections.
- Label collection pipeline (for supervised models) and lender feedback loops.
- SLA & multi-tenant security layer for enterprise customers.
- Sandbox for lenders to simulate rule changes and see cohort impacts.
