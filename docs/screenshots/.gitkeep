# Screenshots Directory

This folder contains screenshots of the MSME Lending application for documentation purposes.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Place your screenshot files in this directory (e.g., `dashboard.png`, `analytics-view.png`)
2. Reference them in README.md using relative paths:
   ```markdown
   ![Description](docs/screenshots/your-image.png)
   ```

## Recommended Image Formats
- PNG for UI screenshots (lossless, supports transparency)
- JPG for photos or images with many colors
- GIF for animated demonstrations

## Naming Convention
Use descriptive kebab-case names:
- `dashboard-overview.png`
- `credit-score-breakdown.png`
- `pipeline-monitor.png`
- `analytics-insights.png`
